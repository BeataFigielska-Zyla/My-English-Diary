            <h2>09.10.2023</h2>
            <p>In September I started lerning programing and coding. My english is not good and I have to practice writting and speaking a lot. My english teacher in GoIT recomends me watching movies in english, writting diary in english, reading books in english. My friend recomends me speaking in english before a mirror. There is a lot of work before me. Because I need to learn coding too, I created a this repozitory. Yesterday I watched american news about war in Israel. It is scary and sad. I do not understend everything what the speaker said.</p>
