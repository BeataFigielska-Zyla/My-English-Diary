            <h2>My first entry</h2>
            <p>In September I started lerning programing and coding. My English is not good and I have to practice writting and speaking a lot. My English teacher in GoIT recomends me watching movies in English, writting diary in English, reading Books in English. My Friend recomends me speaking in English before a mirror. There is a lot of work before me. Because I need to learn coding too, I created a this repozitory.</p>
