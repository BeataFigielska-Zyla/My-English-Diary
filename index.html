        <p class="p-winter"> Yesterday was New Year's Eve. We had fun with friends. Our friend organized a party at his house.The main theme of the event was a masquerade. Everyone was dressed up and had carnival masks on their faces. My mask was black with long black feathers. I wore a shiny black dress, long black gloves and a large
        pearl necklace. The house was beautifully decorated. There was a huge real Christmas tree in the living room.
        There were colorful lights, carnival masks and Christmas decorations everywhere. Everyone brought food and drinks. I made croissants with marmalade and my husband made a salad. We danced and sang all night long. The most fun was when we played charades. Password guessing and alcohol are a funny mix.

        <p class="p-winter"> Today I sewed a dog bed. First, I looked for ideas on the Internet. Then I made a pattern and cut out the fabric. I chose quilted fabric. I sewed the sides of the bed and the bottom, and then stuffed everything with silicone balls and fabric remnants. The dog bed is soft and beautiful. I hope that our future adopted dog will be happy.

                    <p class="p-winter"> Today I woke up with a migraine. The headache was unbearable. In the afternoon we went to my cousin's children's birthday party. Michał is seven old and Krzyś is 5 old. We bought them board games as a gift. One of the games is Millionaires with questions about Polish nature. The second game develops perceptiveness. There are
                    boards with many details that you need to find in time.
